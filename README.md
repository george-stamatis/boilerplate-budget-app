# Budget App

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum for the "Scientific Computing with Python" certification. The Budget App involves completing the Category class in Python to manage budgets for different categories such as food, clothing, and entertainment.

# Project Description

The Budget App requires implementing the Category class in budget.py. This class should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories. Each category object is created with a name and contains a ledger list to track deposits and withdrawals. The class should also have methods for depositing funds, withdrawing funds, transferring funds between categories, checking balances, and generating a spending chart.

This project is written in Python.
